# **Undirected and weighted graphs**

### The project is a task that deals with modeling data structure and algorithms on undirected and weighted graphs.



   ***Algorithms in the project:***
- [x] Testing if the graph is connective
- [x] Calculate the shortest trajectory between two vertices.
- [x] Graph construction.
- [x] Deep copying of a graph.
- [x] save graph to file.
- [x] load graph from file.

*This project was done as part 1 of an OOP study project at Ariel University.
