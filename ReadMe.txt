The project is a task that deals with modeling data structure and algorithms on
undirected and weighted graphs in particular:
1. Testing if the graph is connective
2. Calculate the shortest trajectory between two vertices.
3. Graph construction.
4. Deep copying of a graph.

This project was done as part 1 of an OOP study project at Ariel University.
